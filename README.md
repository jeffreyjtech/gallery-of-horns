## Links and Resources

- Used various Bootstrap docs:
  - [Boostrap Utility docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/) for sizing, border, margin and padding styling.
  - [Bootstrap Grid doc](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) for setting up the card grid.
- Used this [stackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960473/get-all-unique-values-in-a-javascript-array-remove-duplicates) to learn how to filter non-unique values out of an array. This was applied in HornSelector.js.

## Reflections

### Lab 01 reflection

- Thanks to following along with Ryan's demo, I didn't find this to be too hard.
- At first I had issues with the unneeded code added by React and some missing statements but once I addressed those, building the components was a pretty quick process.

### Lab 02 reflection

- These features weren't too bad to implement. Features 1 and 2 were quite easy as we had been demo'd it in class and I followed along at the time.
- Feature 3 took longer since I had to take time to learn new bootstrap features, like cards, containers, rows, and the bootstrap styling utility.

### Lab 03 reflection

- This took much longer than expected but more than half of the elapsed 110 minutes was spent on learning how to pass data between components, helping a classmate with their code, and taking a tea break.
- I ended up spending a good bit of the remaining time troubleshooting my modal component. It wouldn't appear at all! In the end, it was just missing its "show" property.

### Lab 04 reflection

- It was not particularly hard to get the horn filter working. The hardest part was figuring out the best logic for handling the default state of the filter and the "no filter selected" state.
- I had MVP after 45 minutes. The remaining time was spent on a break and CSS adjustments
