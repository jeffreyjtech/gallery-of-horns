## Links and Resources

- Learned how to add margin and borders using the respective [Boostrap Utility docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/api/)

## Reflections

### Lab 01 reflection

- Thanks to following along with Ryan's demo, I didn't find this to be too hard.
- At first I had issues with the unneeded code added by React and some missing statements but once I addressed those, building the components was a pretty quick process.

### Lab 02 reflection

- These features weren't too bad to implement. Features 1 and 2 were quite easy as we had been demo'd it in class and I followed along at the time.
- Feature 3 took longer since I had to take time to learn new bootstrap features, like cards, containers, rows, and the bootstrap styling utility.
